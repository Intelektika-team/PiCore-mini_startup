## **Who We Are:**  
We are a team of young developers (14-17 years old) from the "Kvantorium" technopark (Dimitrovgrad), creating tools to democratize machine learning for students, educators, and aspiring engineers.  

## **The Problem We Solve:**  
Current AI hardware is either **too expensive** (professional solutions) or **underpowered and fragmented** (requiring add-ons and complex setup). There‚Äôs no simple, all-in-one device for learning and experimentation.  

## **Our Solution: PiCore mini**  
A compact computer with built-in ML acceleration.  
**Key advantage:** Ready-to-use out of the box ‚Äî no extra purchases or complicated configurations.  

## **Technical Specs:**  
- **Core hardware:** RP2040 microcontroller + Orange Pi Zero 3 single-board computer.  
- **AI accelerator:** Google Coral TPU module for fast ML tasks (image/speech recognition, etc.).  
- **Connectivity:** 2√ó USB, Ethernet, Micro HDMI, Type-C (power), 15 programmable GPIO pins for sensors/peripherals.  

## **Why PiCore mini Matters:**  

1. **For Education (Schools, STEM Programs):**  
   - Perfect for hands-on AI and robotics classes.  
   - Focus on algorithms, not hardware troubleshooting.  
   - Affordable for equipping entire classrooms.  

2. **For Developers & Makers:**  
   - Real-world ML experience on actual hardware.  
   - Enough power to run pre-trained models and train small networks.  
   - Expandable: 15 GPIO pins for custom projects (sensors, cameras, motors).  

3. **For Investors & Partners:**  
   - Addresses the growing demand for accessible AI education tools.  
   - Scalable potential in EdTech and IoT markets.  
   - Clear roadmap for future development.  

## **Current Status:**  
- ‚úÖ **Hardware:** Board design actively developing.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Software:** Actively developing "plug-and-play" system integration.  
- üîú **Prototypes:** Preparing first functional units for testing.  

## **Future Plans:**  
- **PiCore Duo:** High-performance dual-chip version.  
- **Custom AI accelerator:** Based on Maix K210 chips for greater efficiency.  
- **Open ecosystem:** Releasing documentation and code samples to foster community growth.
